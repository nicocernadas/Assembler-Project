_**Project made for (Systems of Data Processing, first year of TPI, UNSAM)**_

The project was made in a group of 4. Order: Carry out a project of choice in DOSBOX, using Assembler x8086.

Choice: _Space Invaders inspired game._

- 1) "Virtual Machine.zip" contains instructions on downloading and installing TASM, DOSBOX (turbo assembler machine).

- 2) "SpaceTale.zip" contains all the necessary files to run the game, they should all be placed in your "...\tasm1.4\tasm" folder, either way, TASM won't find them.

- 3) To run the game, you should first check if the route to the tasm folder is correct "cd route\to\tasm" (It should be something like "C:\TASM>"). Once you have that done, type "c game14h" and enjoy.
 
> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the file provided 'Game14h.asm' (assembly file) _**does not**_ contain the entire game code, so it won't be playable as it is. If you'd like to try out the full game, feel free to reach out, and I'll be happy to provide it!

Game also has sound, but due to screen-recorder problems, I couldn't include it in the video.

Hope you enjoy!
